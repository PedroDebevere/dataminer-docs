# Site Manager change log

#### 8 September 2025 - New feature - SiteManager 1.0.0 - Ability to communicate from a DaaS system with selected on-premises data sources [ID 42932] [ID 43684] [ID 43685]

With the new SiteManager DxM, it is now possible to create and tear down communication tunnels enabling communication with selected on-premises data sources from a DaaS system. This new module makes use of zrok, a secure, open-source platform that allows private sharing of data sources.

When the DxM has been installed on the DataMiner Agent and the on-premises setup has been configured to enable the connection, users will be able to create elements that communicate with the on-premises data sources by selecting the configured site during element creation.

For detailed information, refer to [About Site Manager](xref:SiteManagerOverview).
