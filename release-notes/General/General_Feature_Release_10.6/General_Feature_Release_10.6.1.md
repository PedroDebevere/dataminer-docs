## Changes

### Enhancements

#### DataMiner Systems will now use the BrokerGateway-managed NATS solution by default [ID 43856]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.6.1 -->

DataMiner Systems will now use the BrokerGateway-managed NATS solution by default. Also, it will no longer be possible to migrate from the BrokerGateway-managed NATS solution (nats-server service) back to the legacy SLNet-managed NATS solution (NAS and NATS services).

- DataMiner upgrades will no longer automatically install NAS and NATS.

- SLReset will now consider the BrokerGateway-managed NATS solution as the default solution, and will remove the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\NATS` folder (if present).

- SLLogCollector will no longer collect any data from the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\NATS` folder.

- In the *MaintenanceSettings.xml* file, the following tags will now be considered obsolete:

  - BrokerGateway
  - NATSDisasterCheck
  - NATSLogFileAmountToKeep
  - NATSLogFileCleanupMs
  - NATSResetWindow
  - NATSRestartTimeout

#### DataMiner upgrade: Prerequisite check 'VerifyBrokerGatewayMigration' will verify whether all DMS in the cluster are using the BrokerGateway-managed NATS solution [ID 43861]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.6.1 -->

During a DataMiner upgrade, the *VerifyBrokerGatewayMigration* prerequisite check will verify whether all DataMiner Agents in the cluster are using the BrokerGateway-managed NATS solution. If not, the check will fail, and the upgrade will not be able to continue.

### Fixes

#### SLNet: Information messages triggered in a QAction would incorrectly only be forwarded to the DMA hosting the element in question [ID 43958]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU10] - FR 10.6.1 -->

When a QAction triggered an information message with regard to a particular element, SLNet would incorrectly only forward that message to the DataMiner Agent that hosted that element. As a result, that information message would not appear in client applications connected to any of the other DataMiner Agents in the system.

#### Failover: 'C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Elements' folder on offline Agents could unexpectedly be cleared [ID 44005]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU10] - FR 10.6.1 -->

In Failover clusters, in some rare cases where specific conditions related to DVE element handling and naming conflicts were met, the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Elements` folder on offline Agents could unexpectedly be cleared, sometimes leaving no elements behind.

To detect whether this has occurred:

- Compare the number of elements on the online and offline Agents.
- Check the offline Agent's Recycle Bin for entries named "Element   deleted", indicating a deletion occurred without a known element name.
