# Site Manager

The Site Manager module is available as a DxM ([DataMiner Extension Module](xref:DataMinerExtensionModules)).
This extension module allows setting up secure communication tunnels enabling communication with selected on-premise data sources from a DaaS system without having to configure e.g. a Site-to-Site VPN.
