# Skyline Communications and DataMiner security

At Skyline Communications, security is a core value. We are committed to providing a flexible, secure and reliable platform.

## Skyline Communications security

The security of the DataMiner platform starts with the security posture of Skyline Communications itself. This is why we continuously invest in strengthening our internal security practices. To demonstrate this commitment, we are working towards compliance with both the [NIS2 directive](xref:DataMiner_compliance_offering#nis2-and-cra-compliance) and the [ISO/IEC 27001 standard](xref:DataMiner_compliance_offering#isoiec-27001-compliance).

## DataMiner Security

With DataMiner, you apply top-tier technology straight across your operation, bringing you a wealth of powerful off-the-shelf options to accelerate your digital transformation. It integrates seamlessly across vendors, technologies, and domains, reducing complexity and minimizing the attack surface compared to point-to-point integrations, but it also means DataMiner's security has to be airtight. That is why we have a dedicated security team focusing exclusively on continuously improving our security stance across all possible aspects of our products. Their work evolves our products in line with industry standards and regulatory frameworks such as the [Cyber Resilience Act](xref:DataMiner_compliance_offering#nis2-and-cra-compliance). To validate these efforts and provide indepentend oversight, an external third party conducts [an extensive penetration test each year]((xref:DataMiner_compliance_offering#annual-security-assessment)) against the latest DataMiner version.

Using a secure platform is only the start of running secure operations. Proper user management is essential to keep access under control and limit privileges to what is strictly needed. DataMiner provides a flexible [user management system](xref:User_management), [fine-grained RBAC system](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions) and [mutilple authentication options](User_management#user-authentication) to support this. The platform also applies [strong encryption](xref:Encryption_in_DataMiner) to allow secure integration with your operations. It is also important to configure the system in a secure way and to maintain that configuration. To help with this, DataMiner has a complete [hardening guide](xref:DataMiner_hardening_guide) and accompanying, built-in [security analyzer](xref:BPA_Security_Advisory).

The dataminer.services platform is a vital part of the DataMiner ecosystem. It extends your DataMniner systemâ€™s capabilities through a [secure cloud connection](xref:Cloud_connectivity_and_security) and offers managed features such as [Storage as a Service](STaaS_features).
These cloud services are hosted on Microsoft Azure ensuring [enterprise-grade security, availability, and compliance](xref:DataMiner_compliance_offering.html#azure-and-dataminerservices).
