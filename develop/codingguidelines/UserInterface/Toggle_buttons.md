# Toggle buttons

- A writeable parameter with only two possible values (e.g. "On/Off" or "Enabled/Disabled') must be implemented as a toggle button if the second value is obvious when you read the first value. In case the second value is not obvious when you read the first, a dropdown box must be used.
